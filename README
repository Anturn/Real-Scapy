Every lab shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

1.Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not
All of Part.1 Part.2 and Part.3 are implemented correctly and thoroughly

2.Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab
I work and discuss the project with classmate, Jianjie Liu,especially for the regular expression part(NLP)

3.Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab
1 + 2 + 4 = 7 hours

4.Based on the IP addresses and from your analysis in part 1, are you really confident that Russians were behind the
election security compromises?
It is not easy in the cyber security world to really "attribute". However, if we just analyze from the IP address,not
too many IPs are from Russia.

5.Are the heuristics used in this lab to determine incidents "even that good"?
No. Because there are many false positive and when the information becomes large, it takes long to find the useful
one.

6.If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or do differently with regards to
detecting incidents?
In some scans(Nikto), it almost report every time and at the same time, it is really redundant to report each and
every type of scan. I will improve the program that will just report the number of scans and type of scans but not
the whole picture. User can delve deeper with other command if they want track further.
